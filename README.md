# Twitch.tv-Giveaway-Bot
A chatbot for Twitch.tv that automates winning giveaways

- [x] Read Chat messages
- [x] Know when at least 5 msgs are the same in a row
- [x] Type that msg in chat
- [x] stop typing in chat for that channel for 10 minutes unless my name has been said
- [x] read chat for my username
- [] print a msg when any msg that contains my name has been said after a minute of my msg being printed (otherwise a bot might @ me to say I've entered rather than won)
- [x] ping the user to let them know they have won/entered the giveaway
- [x] disconnect when a streamer is offline
