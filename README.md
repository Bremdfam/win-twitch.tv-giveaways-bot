# Twitch.tv-Giveaway-Bot
A chatbot for Twitch.tv that automates winning giveaways

- [] Have a list of different things to say when you win
    - mention steam incase the streamer needs to know what platform you're on
- [] Change the cooldown so if a repeat message is detected log it and if the next message is the same within like 10 minutes then don't say it a second time. If it is not the same then say the message.
- [] Add streamer-specific checks the user can modify
    - If a streamer does not require you to re enter giveaway
    - If re-entering makes you leave the giveaway
- [] Refine README
- [] See if you can automatically search twitch titles and categories for !giveaway
