# Twitch.tv-Giveaway-Bot
A chatbot for Twitch.tv that automates winning giveaways

- Read Chat messages
- Know when at least 5 msgs are the same in a row
- filter out chat msgs that @ people and don't contain my name (some bots @ people when they enter a giveaway, filter out those messages)
- Type that msg in chat
- stop typing in chat for that channel for 30 minutes unless my name has been said
- read chat for my username
- print a msg when any msg that contains my name has been said after a minute of my msg being printed (otherwise a bot might @ me to say I've entered rather than won)
- ping the user to let them know they have won/entered the giveaway
